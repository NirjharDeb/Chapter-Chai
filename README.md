# Chapter-Chai
Our project aims to develop an app that helps users find coffee shops and bookstores in a specified area. Using common APIs, the app simplifies the search for places to relax and enjoy coffee, especially in unfamiliar locations. The goal is to provide a quick, easy way to discover nearby coffee shops and bookstores.
